Sofie aims to enhance the KATTIS experience (tm) and act as a personal assistant.

sofie config <param> <value>
no parameters: display all settings (which are stored in ~/.kattissrc)
if ~/.kattissrc does not exist ==> prompt user to login and give link to file
given some parameters, update ~/.kattissrc
config is stored in some easy-to-parse format (backwardscompatible)

includes:
kattis url (by default kattis.scrool.se)
username and token
default parameters for init and submit


sofie init <problem/session>
creates a .sofie directory with configuration settings.
test directory with any available tests, both downloadable and parseable.
optionally: create all of the above in a subdirectory named <problem> (-p)
optionally: download description to 'desc' with -d switch.
all of the above are repeated for all problems if a session is given.


sofie submit <problem>
requires a .sofie directory being present, or submits to the specified problem id
identifies the language in use and which files will be sent to kattis
automatically selects all files and submits them to kattis, saving submission id
outputs new status until the submission is failed/accepeted
finally saves a short history log within the .sofie directory, available offline
includes: <session>, problem id, submission id, status, time occupied
supports parameters: --verbose --quiet --submit
