Sofie aims to enhance the KATTIS experience (tm) and act as a personal assistant.

rev1: sofie init <problem> [-p]
      [mkdir workingdir]
      [cd workingdir]
      mkdir tests; mkdir .sofie 
      write .sofie/config with problem id
      [retrieve all tests]

      sofie submit
      read .sofie/config, find problem id
      read all source files in the current dir, recursively
      determine language, only support for C++
      make submission, retrieve submission id
      poll submission id until complete, print status in each step
      finally register submission id and result in .sofie/results

      sofie stats
      verify that .sofie exists with necessary files
      print problem id
      print all results stored in the current dir as {id} {date/time} {status}
      print if ever accepted

Current TODO list:
  * Add proper CLI for choosing a submodule or launching help section.
  * Add basic stats command
  * Expand submit command to read specified files, or find them, and language id.
    Could accept accept/ignore list from CLI, using +- syntax.
  * Expand submit to wait for kattis-completion.
  * Cabalize
  * Add documentation.
  * Test.
